Youtube History Searcher

This is a python application which allows you to search for an English word or phrase in your YouTube history. Since the Youtube history search engine is limited to the video's metadata and cannot search its content, this program is the perfect tool to help you recover the video you have been looking for.

Note: current version only available to Mac users. It is also assumed that you have a Youtube brand account. This application currently does not support normal accounts.

Requirements:
  - Geckodriver latest release
  - Firefox latest release

After installing Geckodriver, please edit path to geckodriver in line 35 history.py (e.g. /Users/myname/Downloads/geckodriver)
